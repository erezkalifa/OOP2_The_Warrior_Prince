## Introduction
The Prince Warrior is a 2D game.
The game is called "The Warrior Prince", because in order to win the game, the player (who controls the character of the prince) has to eliminate all the invaders to the kingdom.
The game consists of 4 stages of increasing difficulty. In order to finish each stage, the player must first defeat all the monsters in that stage, and only then can he kill the bosses. After all the invaders in the stage are eliminated - a gate will open through which the player will advance in the game towards the next stage.
The enemies:
The enemies in the game are the "bosses" and the monsters, with the bosses being stronger: more resistant to death, more agile, and their damage to the prince takes 3 points off his life, compared to 2 from a monster damage.
Additional elements:
The player can collect the coins that are revealed when each invader is eliminated.
With the coins, the player can collect armor, more expensive armor, and an upgraded rifle. (The player starts the game with a gun that shoots one single bullet with each press of the space bar. The upgraded rifle fires 3 bullets at the same time that resemble a triangle shape.
